# Time complexity symbols:
    1. Ω - Big Omega is used to repsent the best-case scenario of an algorithm.
            When an algorithm is fiven the simplestes data-structure possible as input.
    2. O - BigO is used to repsent the worst-case scenario of an algorithm.
            When an algorithm is given a very large and comples data-set as input
    3. Θ - Big Theta is used only when the time complexity of an algorithm is the
            the same in both worst-case and best-case scenarios.
